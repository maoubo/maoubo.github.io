Hi, I‚Äôm Oubo Ma, a third-year PhD student at Zhejiang University in the NESA Lab, advised by Prof. [Shouling Ji](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=5HoF_9oAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). My research focuses on the security of reinforcement learning (RL), including adversarial policies and backdoor attacks.

My passion for RL actually started with my love of puzzle games. Over time, I noticed that while most researchers focus on enhancing RL algorithms‚Äô performance across various tasks, there‚Äôs less emphasis on addressing their security risks. This gap in attention drives my commitment to revealing the potential vulnerabilities of RL from multiple perspectives and developing solutions to improve the safety and reliability of RL in real-world applications. Beyond academics, I‚Äôm a big fan of basketball and comedy. If you‚Äôd like to chat about any of these topics, please feel free to email me!
